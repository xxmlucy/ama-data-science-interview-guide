- [Evaluation Metrics](./Machine_Learning/Evaluation_Metrics/README.md) - How to measure model performance

### [Other Concepts](./Other_Concepts/README.md)

Additional specialized knowledge areas that may be relevant:

- [Time Series Forecasting](./Other_Concepts/Time_Series.md)
- [Computer Vision](./Other_Concepts/Computer_Vision.md)
- [Reinforcement Learning](./Other_Concepts/Reinforcement_Learning.md)

### [Case Study](./Case_Study/README.md)

Practice for open-ended data science problems commonly asked in interviews:

- [Diagnose a Problem](./Case_Study/Diagnose_Problem.md) - Identifying issues in metrics or models
- [Measure Success](./Case_Study/Measure_Success.md) - Defining KPIs and success criteria
- [Launch or not](./Case_Study/Launch_Decision.md) - Making decisions based on data

## Interview Preparation Strategy

### 1. Assess Your Skills

Start by identifying your strengths and weaknesses across the knowledge areas. Focus your study time on areas where you need improvement.

### 2. Study Core Concepts

Review the fundamental concepts in each area, ensuring you understand both the theory and practical applications.

### 3. Practice Problems

Work through example problems and interview questions. Practice explaining your thought process out loud.

### 4. Practice SQL Daily

SQL questions appear in almost every data science interview. Practice regularly with platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or StrataScratch.

### 5. Prepare for Case Studies

Case studies test your ability to approach open-ended problems. Practice framing problems, identifying metrics, and communicating your analysis.

### 6. Mock Interviews

Conduct mock interviews with peers or mentors to get feedback on your communication and problem-solving approaches.

## Common Interview Formats

### Technical Screen

- Usually 45-60 minutes
- SQL questions
- Probability and statistics questions
- Basic ML concepts
- Coding questions (Python/R)

### Take-Home Assignment

- Data analysis or modeling task
- Typically 2-5 hours to complete
- Focus on clean code, clear documentation, and insightful analysis

### Onsite/Virtual Loop

- Multiple interview rounds (4-6 typically)
- SQL and coding rounds
- Statistical reasoning and ML rounds
- Case study or business problem
- Behavioral questions
- System design for senior roles

## Interview Success Tips

1. **Communicate clearly**: Explain your thought process step-by-step.
2. **Ask clarifying questions**: Ensure you understand the problem before solving it.
3. **Structure your approach**: Outline how you'll tackle a problem before diving into details.
4. **Connect to business context**: Relate technical concepts to business value.
5. **Be honest about limitations**: If you don't know something, acknowledge it and describe how you'd approach learning it.
6. **Show passion for data**: Demonstrate curiosity and enthusiasm for solving problems with data.
